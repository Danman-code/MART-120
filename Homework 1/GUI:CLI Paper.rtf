\f0\fs24 \cf0 The graphical user interface is intended to provide an easy and intuitive way to interact with applications. It can provide icons to make navigation easier for a user. A command line interface is a text based interface, and allows the user to know exactly what the program is doing and also allows more overall control over the application. However, a CLI is more complicated and requires a more advanced understanding to operate. \
